<p>SWOSU grad who’s done everything from freelance work, the startup scene, and even some  government contract work. I’ve done frontend and backend work (and even some mobile) in everything from Java to Javascript (except C++, not a huge fan…). I don’t always code, but when I do I like to do it well… When I’m not coding I’m running, playing soccer, brewing beer, or anything that doesn’t involve a computer.</p>

<p>Waylon started out in a town with not so much as a calculus class anywhere in a 50 mile radius and began teaching himself to program when he was 11. He eventually got degrees in Physics and Math and wrote the software they use to test astronauts on the International Space Station. The first game he ever loved was Final Fantasy on the NES. Now he thinks games are the future of the world and he’s dedicated his life to making life more fun.</p>

<p>With so many great tools available to front-end web developers these days it can sometimes be difficult to understand how they all fit together. Deciding on a workflow that you�re happy with is often a very personal endeavour, but getting started isn�t always easy. Yeoman aims to solve this problem by scaffolding workflows for creating modern webapps, while at the same time mixing in many of the best practices that have evolved within the industry.</p>
<p>Simply put, Yeoman is a scaffolding tool, that will save you time should you adopt it. If you write JavaScript, a lot of good tooling has come along that really encourages a modern workflow. Yeoman is one of these tools. Lets check it out together on Tuesday.</p>

<p>Lightning Talks are a lot of fun. Its an open forum where our members can get up and talk about what they want. The talks need to be short - generally 5-10 minutes. You can cover anything that is javascript, or related to javascript. You can talk about a problem you’ve solved, a plugin you like, a cool blog post you read, something you’re working on now, or pretty much any other way you’re using javascript to achieve your goals.</p>
<p>Since these tend to be pretty popular, we’ve started a ‘signup’ on the Google + page. By ‘signup’ I meann “post a comment in the thread”. It’s basically first come, first serve. Or FIFO. Whatever :)<br><a id="more"></a></p>

Have you come across a useful plugin lately? Have you recently solved a hard problem with javascript or related technologies? Now is your chance to present it! </p>
<p>This is pretty informal. If you don’t sign up, you can still talk if there’s time, and if you do sign up you can change your mind. Ithe signup is just so if anyone really wants to talk they can be guaranteed a spot, is all.</p>

<p>@The Exchange<br>700 1/2 W. Sheridan Ave.,<br>Oklahoma City, Oklahoma<br>73102</p>
<h2 id="“About_“Phonegap”">“About “Phonegap”</h2>
<p>Are you excited about all the mobile technologies available today but you can’t decide which language to learn? Is your company planning to build a mobile app but you can’t decide which platform to invest in first? The answer is simple: don’t choose! In this session I will show you how you can use the PhoneGap framework to build an app using just HTML, Javascript and CSS that will compile to a native app. Along the way, I’ll point out various performance tips, helper libraries and design patters to make your app experience awesome on all devices. Your app will be ready for submission to each platform’s app store and will install and run natively all from a single code base!</p>

<p>I bet you’ve been writing JS for years and you think you’re pretty good at it. I bet you think you know all about how functions create closured scope, and how <code>this</code> gets bound, and even how <code>.prototype</code> works. Or, rather, you probably don’t care because your framework or library takes care of all that for you.</p>
<p>JavaScript is generally considered one of the most misunderstood (and maligned) languages of the modern programming era. And there’s good reason for that, because most developers who write JS never actually deeply <em>know</em> how the language works. They blame all their WTFs on language bugs, instead of the shortcomings in understanding.</p>

<p>If you’ve never heard of our lightning talks before, here is how it goes:</p>
<p>Lightning talks are a lot of fun. Its an open forum where our members can get up and talk about what they want. The talks need to be short - generally 5-10 minutes. You can cover anything that is javascript, or related to javascript. You can talk about a problem you’ve solved, a plugin you like, a cool blog post you read, something you’re working on now, or pretty much any other way you’re using javascript to achieve your goals. </p>

<p><img src="/images/logos/shang_js.png" class="" float-left="" rounded-corner-all""="" width="200" title="JavascriptRainbows"><br>This month it is all about you, our Okcjs Members. This meeting will be entirely user driven. Have you been working on something cool you want to share? Have you come across a useful plugin lately? Have you recently solved a hard problem with javascript or related technologies? Now is your chance to present it! There will be an ad hoc signup on the community page. This is pretty informal. If you don’t sign up, you can still talk if there’s time, and if you do sign up you can change your mind. I’m just putting it there so if anyone really wants to talk they can be guaranteed a spot, is all.</p>

<p>Ember Js bills itself as a framework for creating ambitious web applications. Its a strong system integrating data binding, templates, and common idioms so you can focus on what makes a web app special, without reinventing the wheel. Perhaps you’ve worked in other frameworks, and have wondered what makes Ember exceptional. </p>
<p>Now is your chance to learn, and Jeremy Green is going to be your guide on a titillating code safari deep into the trenches of Ember.</p>

<p>Ember Js bills itself as a framework for creating ambitious web applications. Its a strong system integrating data binding, templates, and common idioms so you can focus on what makes a web app special, without reinventing the wheel. Perhaps you’ve worked in other frameworks, and have wondered what makes Ember exceptional. </p>
<p>Now is your chance to learn, and Jeremy Green is going to be your guide on a titillating code safari deep into the trenches of Ember.</p>

<p>You’ve probably played with some by now, and if not, you should take a gander at some of the more interesting ones. Javascript is a surprisingly robust and fun environment to for making games that can run in your browser.</p>
<p>Of the many game engines, a few will stick out. Impact.js is one of the ones worth your attention.</p>
<p>Why Impact? I’ll show you. Bring your laptop to the next meeting - you’re going to use it. We’re going to assemble a simple game together in no time with Impact.js, and you can see why it is an effective and expressive system for creating content. We’ll examine Impact’s built in AMD, clear design patterns, animation system, awesome level master and useful debugging tools. We’ll also look at how the system is extensible, and can even host external tools within.</p>
<p>Don’t miss this meeting, you’re in for a javascript treat! Dominique, the developer of Impact has been so kind to give us a usergroup licence for noncommertial use of Impact. If you’ve been curious about Impact.js but haven’t had a chance to see what the fuss is about, now you can know! </p>

<p>We liked our last lightning talks so much, we want to do it again!  If you’ve never been involved in one of those before, its pretty simple: Its an open forum where our members can get up and talk about what they want. The talks need to be short - generally 5-10 minutes. You can cover anything that is javascript, or related to javascript. You can talkabout a problem you’ve solved, a plugin you like, a cool blog post you read, something you’re working on now, or pretty much any other way you’re using javascript to achieve your goals.<br><a id="more"></a></p>

<h2 id="“About_“Overdrive_Your_Javascript”">“About “Overdrive Your Javascript”</h2>
<p>This month, we are going to rev up your Javascript RPM’s to the Full Throttle Ultimate Extreme Maximum&trade;. There’s many ways to drive your Javascript. Some methods are more successful than others. I tried hot gluing a steering wheel to my computer case, and found that technique to be largely ineffective. Don’t make the same mistake I did! Come to this month’s meeting and let some experts show you how to insert driving pun here!</p>
<p>One technique available is to run a test driver. This means you use a navigation  and scripting testing utility to ensure your code is running smoothly. How can you ensure your enduser’s web experience has set the cruise control to cool? You need to test your javascript! You can auto fill and submit forms, define and order browsing navigation steps, capture screenshots, log events, scrape web content and a host of other things to make sure your site is really working. CasperJS is a tool for the job, and Michael Sarchet is going to help you get started.</p>
<p>Another way to drive your Javascript is to implement a library to help make autonomous characters move in a realistic manner. The general term for this is ‘steering behavior’. This can include wandering, seeking and randomness, avoidance, and any other way things ‘move’. You might need to do this if you’re implementing some advanced interactivity, building a game, or doing some creative project. Ben VanTreese is working on a library to do this in javascript, and he is going to present it at this month’s meeting.</p>
