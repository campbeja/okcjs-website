## About "Free Yourself from the Browser with Electron"
Let Electron take you where no JavaScript has been beforeâ€¦

We use JavaScript on the client-side and server-side. Now, with Electron, we can take JavaScript offline. Electron uses Chromium and Node, and is accessible across multiple operating systems. Electron has been used to build apps like Slack, Atom, and Visual Studio Code.

This talk will teach all you need to know to start writing your first offline apps with JavaScript and Electron.
