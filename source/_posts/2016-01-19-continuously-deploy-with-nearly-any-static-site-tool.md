## About "Continuously deploy with nearly any static site tool"
You may have used the Jekyll integration in Github Pages for your site; but moved onto some other static tool or host. In this talk you will see how to regain a continuous deployment process for virtually any static site generator; with the added benefit of site previews of contributions. Join us and discover how you can keep delivering and have your static site too.
