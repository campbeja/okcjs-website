##About "Thunder Plains"
Anyone who has been following OKC.js for long has heard of Thunder Plains and hopefully everyone got to go! If you missed out or were torn between two classes and cursed yourself for only being able to be in one place at a time, you should consider joining us as we review all the talks and activities that makes Thunder Plains so great.

Thunder Plains is a web and mobile developer conference put on by the organizers of OKC.js and founders of Techlahoma. Please visit [thunderplainsconf.com](http://thunderplainsconf.com/) to learn all about it. You may even compare how much our conference has grown from last year if you visit [2013.thunderplainsconf.com](http://2013.thunderplainsconf.com/).
