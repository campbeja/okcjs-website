##About "Angular with React.js"
Apples and Oranges. Oil and Water. The Capulets and Montagues.

...Angular and React?

It's all over the blogs and at every conference. They come from different worlds. One uses two-way binding. The other uses one-way. One is highly declarative; the other is "code-first". One wears short skirts, the other wears T-shirts. But, that doesn't mean one gets to be cheer captain while the other sits on the bleachers.

Let's look at both of these popular tools and see what they have to offer. Let's discuss them; not from a standpoint of "better and worse" but "where and why". This talk will be a bit of an overview of both tools, followed by a deeper dive into the mentality between the two.
