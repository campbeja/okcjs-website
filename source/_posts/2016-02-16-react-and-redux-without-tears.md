## About "React and Redux, without the tears"
This talk will take you through Redux with React, but without the big, confusing, house of cards-like toolchain often presented in beginner tutorials. It’ll start by showing how you can get React; and ES6 transpilation, with JSX, up and running in literally minutes—without any gulp tasks, or even build steps required prior to running. The bulk of the talk will be a somewhat deep dive into Redux, covering best practices and common mistakes, and of course how React easily and beautifully ties in to turn your Redux store into a functioning UI.
